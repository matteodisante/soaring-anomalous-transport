"""Vilpellet's binary-feature flight-phase segmenter, transcribed for this repository.

This package is a port, not a second attempt at the problem.  It reproduces the
segmentation of Vilpellet et al. (2026) as their code performs it: three binary
features per fix, a three-state hidden Markov model whose emissions are a categorical
law over the eight possible feature triples, Viterbi decoding under parameters fitted
once on 2019 Alpine paraglider flights, and a rolling majority vote over the decoded
path.  No parameter is re-estimated here.

It exists alongside :mod:`soaring.analysis.segmentation`, the continuous-emission
Gaussian model of Chapter 4.  The two answer the same question from different
observations -- binary indicators at the logger's own cadence against standardised
kinematic means on a ten-second grid -- and which of them the thesis finally adopts is
open.  Keeping both runnable is what lets that question be settled by measurement.

Typical use::

    from soaring.analysis.segmentation.vilpellet import (
        load_vilpellet_config, segment_flight,
    )

    config = load_vilpellet_config()
    track = segment_flight(result.fixes, config, discipline="paragliders")
    climb = track.fixes.loc[track.fixes["phase"] == "climb"]
